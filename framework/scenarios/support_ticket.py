    This previously raised when a clean ticket contained a catalog literal,

    tripped on was the generator's own identifier. It passed only because the
    test fixture used a rule count small enough to select no colliding rule.

    Expected output is now computed by scanning the full catalog, so a stray
    literal no longer corrupts the expected result; it only mislabels a record
    as clean. Generation reports the count, so repairing quietly here does not
    hide the condition. Aborting a 10,000 document run over one identifier
